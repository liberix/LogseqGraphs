title:: <section>

- Represents a section of a document. Each `section` has a heading tag (`h1`-`h6`), then the section body.
- Example:
	- ```
	  <section>
	      <h2>A section of the page</h2>
	      <p>...</p>
	      <img ...>
	  </section>
	  ```
- It's useful to break a long article into different sections.
- Shouldn't be used as a generic container element. [[<div>]] is made for this.
