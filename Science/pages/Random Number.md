- Why `random.seed()`
	- pseudo-random number generators require a previous value

		- Pseudo-random number generators work by performing some operation on a
		   value. Generally this value is the previous number generated by the 
		  generator. However, the first time you use the generator, there is no 
		  previous value.
		- Seeding a pseudo-random number generator gives it its first 
		  "previous" value. Each seed value will correspond to a sequence of 
		  generated values for a given random number generator. That is, if you 
		  provide the same seed twice, you get the same sequence of numbers twice.
		- Generally, you want to seed your random number generator with some 
		  value that will change each execution of the program. For instance, the 
		  current time is a frequently-used seed. The reason why this doesn't 
		  happen automatically is so that if you want, you can provide a specific 
		  seed to get a known sequence of numbers.
